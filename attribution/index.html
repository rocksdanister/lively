                  Version 2, June 1991

                  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
                  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
                  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                  Preamble

                  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                  your programs, too.

                  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

                  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

                  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                  rights.

                  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                  distribute and/or modify the software.

                  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                  authors' reputations.

                  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                  modification follow.

                  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

                  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

                  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                  along with the Program.

                  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

                  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

                  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                  parties under the terms of this License.

                  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                  License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

                  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

                  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                  collective works based on the Program.

                  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                  the scope of this License.

                  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

                  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

                  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                  customarily used for software interchange; or,

                  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                  to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                  received the program in object code or executable form with such
                  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

                  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                  itself accompanies the executable.

                  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

                  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                  parties remain in full compliance.

                  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                  the Program or works based on it.

                  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                  this License.

                  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

                  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                  circumstances.

                  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                  impose that choice.

                  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

                  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

                  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                  address new problems or concerns.

                  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                  Foundation.

                  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                  NO WARRANTY

                  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

                  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

                  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

                  &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
                  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

                  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
                  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
                  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
                  (at your option) any later version.

                  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
                  GNU General Public License for more details.

                  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
                  with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
                  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

                  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

                  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
                  when it starts in an interactive mode:

                  Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
                  Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

                  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
                  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
                  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

                  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
                  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
                  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

                  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
                  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
                  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
                  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
                  Public License instead of this License.

                  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

                  1. Definitions.

                  "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                  and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

                  "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
                  the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                  "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                  other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                  "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                  exercising permissions granted by this License.

                  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
                  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                  source, and configuration files.

                  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                  and conversions to other media types.

                  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                  subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                  as of the date such litigation is filed.

                  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                  meet the following conditions:

                  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

                  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

                  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

                  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                  the conditions stated in this License.

                  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                  replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                  the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                  comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                  file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                  same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                  identification within third-party archives.
